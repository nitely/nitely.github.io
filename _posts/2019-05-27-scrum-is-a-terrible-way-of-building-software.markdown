Scrum is not a software development methodology, it's a management methodology and a terrible one at it. It sucks the energy out of the programmers. The amount of micromanaging (or self-micromanaging) is absurd.

Every start-up I've worked for moved to Scrum after a few years in the field. There are many reasons for doing this: being able to quantify the effort a project will take, keep it on schedule, track what the team is working on and so on.

Well, I've news for you. No programmer likes Scrum. [It adds zero benefits to a development team, only cruft](https://medium.com/@jsonpify/you-dont-need-standup-9a74782517c1). Daily stand-ups, sprint planning, ticket estimations, retrospectives, demos, ugh!

Any improvements to the actual software development process like improving communication across teams, knowing what every teammate is working on, etc are not things that Scrum brings and can not be implemented in a less formal process. One that is less focused on *control* and more focused on *trust*.

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools, early and continuous delivery, short and frequent iterations, been able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely, etc are Agile principles, not Scrum principles. [Scrum is not Agile](http://www.dennisweyland.net/blog/?p=43).

As far as software development goes, a weekly --or every other week-- stand-up without managers, a priority queue of tasks and a monthly report to other teams would suffice for most companies I've worked for. For managers asking for estimations, just count the number of solved issues in a month, that's a good enough prediction of the number of solved tickets in any given month. This is just a starting point and it won't work for every team. *There is no one-size-fit-all*.

Programmers are unhappy on *tightly* (self-)managed groups. There's data to back this up. I won't gather it, though. It should be enough for anyone to read any comment section for some Scrum article in the many news aggregators focused on tech. There are also plenty of articles about how Scrum is not an improvement to any software development process [0]. But even so, higher-ups will choose Scrum over and over again. To be fair, they probably have never been on the other side of a Scrum team, the programmer side, either that or they simply do not know better.

Happy programmers are *a lot* more productive [1]. So, unless the whole team is happy doing Scrum, the overall team productivity will decrease.

The thing is, there is no silver bullet when it comes to building software. A good development team will be able to deliver good software *despite* Scrum, but for how long?
