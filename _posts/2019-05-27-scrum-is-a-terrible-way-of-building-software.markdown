Scrum is not a software development methodology, it's a management methodology and a terrible one at it. It sucks the energy out of the programmers. The amount of micromanaging (or self-micromanaging) is absurd.

Every start-up I've worked for moved to doing Scrum after a few years in the field, usually when expanding or simply when growing their teams. There are many reasons for doing this: being able to quantify the effort a project will take, estimate how long it will take, track what the team is working on and so on. This is why I say it's a management methodology and not a development methodology.

Well, I've news for you. No programmer likes Scrum. [It adds zero benefits to a development team, only cruft](https://medium.com/@jsonpify/you-dont-need-standup-9a74782517c1). Daily stand-ups, sprint planning, ticket estimations, sprint retrospectives, demos, ugh!

Any improvements to the actual software development process, like improving communication across teams, knowing what every team-mate is working on, etc are not things that Scrum brings and can not be implemented in a less formal process.

As far as software development goes, a weekly stand-up without managers, a priority queue of tasks and a monthly report to other teams would suffice for most companies I've worked for. For managers asking for estimations, just count the number of solved issues in a month, that's a good enough prediction of the number of solved tickets in any given month.

There's data to back this up. I won't gather it, though. It should be enough for anyone to read any comment section for some Scrum article in the many news aggregators focused on tech. There are plenty of articles about how Scrum is not an improvement over other methodologies for ~~managing~~ building software [0]. But even so, higher-ups will choose Scrum over and over again. To be fair, they probably have never being on the other side of a Scrum team, the programmer side, either that or they simply do not know better.

The only positive opinions towards Scrum to be found are about how it is almost always poorly implemented, so according to this everyone implements it the wrong way. So, what good is it if it's usually not implemented properly?

It's widely understood by now that there is no silver bullet when it comes to building software. Do whatever works for your team is the norm and that is fine. It's a good way of building software.
